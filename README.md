# Amount-Spent-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression

We got contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

Now we have to predict whether we should focus on mobile site or the website.
